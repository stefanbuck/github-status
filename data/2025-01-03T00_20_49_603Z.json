The backfilled metadata will be available in a few days.<br /><br />Until the backfill is complete, there are several actions you can take to ensure an Action runs:<br />- Any Actions that should have run on closed but not merged PRs can be triggered by re-opening and re-closing the PR.<br />- Actions that should have run on PR merge can be re-run from the main branch of your repository.<br /><br />The only Actions that cannot be re-run at this time are ones that specifically use the merge commit.<br /><br />Additionally, the `merge_commit_sha` field on an impacted Pull Request will be `null` when queried via our API until the backfill completes.<br /><br />We appreciate the error reports we received, and thank you for your patience. We mitigated the initial impact quickly by rolling back a feature flag. We will be improving the monitoring of our feature flag rollouts in the future to better catch these scenarios.",
