# github-status

Isn't it dumb to use GitHub to track the reliability of GitHub? Well, it depends. If you need instant response whenever an incident is happening, for sure it is. But this repository serves a different need, a historical overview of incidenses. Therfore it doesn't matter if the data arrive an hour later, as long as github replay all delayed events at some point.
